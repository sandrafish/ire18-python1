# Python 1 IRE 2018

These files will be used in the Python 1 session at IRE 2018. They are set up with Python 3 and Jupyter notebook for Python 3.

To use these at home you'll want to install [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) from the command line.

## Resources, etc.

Some general concepts:
* #document your code
* Google is your friend when you get those error messages
* [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) can be super helpful too
* Expect to make mistakes - typing correctly 100% is impossible and many errors are misspelled words, missing commas, wrong indentation
* Search github 
* [Join Python Journos email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pythonjournos)
* Practice. Try [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) or the Py app for your phone.
* Work on a project. Start with something simple, like a program to download and open a file.
* Ben Welsh has [great Django](http://first-django-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [data journalism](http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/) tutorials online.
* Work with others. Look for meetups in your area. My fave is [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) â€“ and they welcome guys, too.
